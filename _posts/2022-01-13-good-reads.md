There is a question in Zhihu (aka. Quora in China) asked "what's the programming book made you WoW?". That's the trigger that I should allocate a post for those highly impactful books in my career, they are not limited to programming, they are more about the tech industry, both skills and instruments.

- Unix Programming Art
- Hack and painters
- Refactoring
- 7 Habits
- DDIA
