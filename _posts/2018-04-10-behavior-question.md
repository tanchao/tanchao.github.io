## 04/10/2018 shadow interview with zchen@

* Why do you want to work in Amazon?
* Project you major contributed for?
* Hardest challenge?

```
I prefer open end questions and catch data points with focus, as the position requires Sr SDE, when he mentioned project he owned or challenged, I want to hear something interrupted with other teams or impact on managers, as a Sr SDE of Amazon, it requires impact among teams and senior managers. I also want to see his proactive impact on managers and projects not just do the task.
