When I left Amazon, I scheduled 1-1s with leaders and friends to farewell (virtually) in person. During these chats, mostly my gratefulness to work with them and memories we shared, also seeked some last-min feedbacks, and a little bit uncertainty about next adventure. I promised that I would get back once I figure it out.

I took a 2-weeks gap traveling around northen western Washington, in the middle of the trip, I got the news that my green card arrived home, so I drove home and grabbed the gc and de-routed 1-week to Vancouver, CA. First time visiting Canada, first time camping, first time to the northern western point, a fullfilling trip. I felt lucky and deeply appreciated for things moving smoothly.

I landed Snowflake after the short break by end of Aug. what I have done in past month:
1. 1w Boot Camp;
2. Lots of reading and training;
3. A ramp up task within the team under others' coach, just finished my 3rd PR in python for a ML pipeline, almost done with one step of them;
  a. some contributions on how pipeline should be organized. 
5. Suggested a new way to project setup so that we could do development easier with IDE;
6. Some comments and reviews.
