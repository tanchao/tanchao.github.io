As I am leaving Amazon and pursue my next adventure, what are the essential good work habits that I want to keep?

Lots of things listed on this blog, but what are the critical ones?

0. Be an owner with growth mindset
1. Hands-on and Dive deep with operation tasks
2. Understand tech debts and try to prioritize and evaluate impact with them
3. get my own things done first
