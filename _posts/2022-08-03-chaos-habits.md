As I am leaving Amazon and pursue my next adventure, what are the essential good work habits that I want to keep?

Lots of things listed on this blog, but what are the critical ones?

0. Be an owner with growth mindset
1. Hands-on and Dive deep with operation tasks
  1. learn system the hard way: a) refact it, break it, fix it; b) support ops and ticket, 5-whys and fix the root cause so that the issue remain fixed; c) figure out the architecture part that hard to change; d) observe their performance benchmark. 
2. Understand tech debts and try to prioritize and evaluate impact with them
3. get my own things done first
