Quote from my linkedin post (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tanchao_kidsplay-designpattern-activity-6821708682187935744-7rTJ):
```
fault tolerance >>> high performance ==> stable availability

Not from technical study but my 4yr old son's basketball bouncing experience. After he swift the focus on "how to bounce the ball back to normal rhythm" instead of "bouncing the ball correctly", he can bounce more than 100 times now, compare to an average of 10-20s few days ago.

First time feeling some design concept helps in real life ::joker::
