After I transform my word resume from word to markdown, I felt boring.
So here we are with a better version.

# TC

## Who am I

* believe in "SDE = Somebody Do Everything", so not a pure engineer but a real problem solver.
* believe in myself, confident to handle any problems; also know my limitation, and voice out if I'm there.
  * more specific, *any* probably limit to *technically* at this time.
* believe in automation, since my work at eBay, learning from an awesome tech leader (Eric T.), #automate.everything.
* current interest is `dynamic software system performance tuning`, particularly the full-backend-stack, including clients, services, data store and its environment.

## What I am looking for

* I grew much faster when I was working with `great people`
* Amazon taught me how importantly the culture matters, so I am looking for next company with `its own culture`
* `Business model` determines fast vs normal lanes

## What did I do

* I `coded` since 2004 with B.S. in computer science; I actually programmed in my first job at 2008, which added `debugging, testing and deploying`; I named myself developer when I was in Singaore around 2010, when I started `creating softwares` beyond the job responsibility; I grew to a good engineer at eBay with a tech lead coaching me with `the automation methodology` at 2012; I became a senior engineer at HSBC after `led a gloal distributed engineer pod`.
* I am more than a software engineer here at Amazon, "SDE" now wearing TPM/PM/TL/Mentor all different hats. We pay attention to customer experience and business model, own end to end outcome; I could measure, observe and reason really really really complicated systems (hundreds of services) and offer alternative solutions for different purpose under various constraints; I could focus on the mechanism, process and culture to ensure the tech team is with a good habit so that whole E.E. (engineering excellence) is efficient; I could own as much as I am motivated to, O.E. (operational excellece), product, feature, design, code review, code change and wikis, for example my recent favorite was the launch plan for new buddy.

## What I am good at

* keeping customer and business outcome first
* watching over dynamic system end-to-end, including operational excellence
* making right technical trade-offs (as best I can) and balance between delivery vs perfection
* subject matter expert on some domains: developer platform, micro-services, API design, Java Runtime
* managing complex projects and/or dealing with complex situations: long running project, turn-red-to-green, plan-b etc.
* leading engineer team via mechanism (coded or forced process), standards (normal process) and documentation
* mastering production incident handling (ACL) and trouble shooting
* staying foolish and hungry

## What I am not good at

* I am emotional sometimes, that increase my ego during that period
* I prefer straight forward with my constructive feedbacks, as I don't master English language well so make it simple.

## Why change?

* I benefited a lot from Amazon's culture and mechanisms, I believe there are many other great learnings from other great organizations; I'd like to explore.
* I, like suddenly, felt that I was ready to graduate, I might be able to contribute my expertise (really like a pro) to next great success.

## Why now?

* I kept my eye open and always ready for next rocket ship
* I got my combo card recently and is waiting for my green card final process, eta. by May'22
